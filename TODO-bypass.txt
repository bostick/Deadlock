on startup, render world panel big enough for zooming


figure out best way for zoom to follow car
so that dragging is not interrupted


SOON:

spiraling in GPPP.generalSearch?



easter egg: click on a grass, do something
something: cars are now intangible
in board description, a missing - or | means to allow the car off of the board...



DONE:

add perimeters around joint studs

when goign from stud to stud, always coast to the next stud, not to the previous one

make sure dragging doesn't get snagged

add long road from exit

coast from winning position off screen

test boards with exits on left and right, make sure exiting works

catch cars that are coasting

flicking

fix releasing on a vertex, snapping and blocking road

do coasting within the board, from stud to stud
 
when dragging, determine whether to coast forward or backward

save first vertex visited when dragging.

when released on a road, try to go to the other vertex (if space is available)



stop coasting after reentering board
