test boards with exits on left and right, make sure exiting works





figure out best way for zoom to follow car
so that dragging is not interrupted




add long road from exit

coast from winning position off screen





SOON:

make sure dragging doesn't get snagged
 
DONE:

flicking

fix releasing on a vertex, snapping and blocking road

do coasting within the board, from stud to stud
 
when dragging, determine whether to coast forward or backward

save first vertex visited when dragging.

when released on a road, try to go to the other vertex (if space is available)



stop coasting after reentering board
