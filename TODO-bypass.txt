fix releasing on a vertex, snapping and covering up road


make sure dragging doesn't get snagged


flicking





figure out best way for zoom to follow car
so that dragging is not interrupted



 
 
 DONE:

do coasting within the board, from stud to stud
 
when dragging, determine whether to coast forward or backward

save first vertex visited when dragging.

when released on a road, try to go to the other vertex (if space is available)



stop coasting after reentering board
