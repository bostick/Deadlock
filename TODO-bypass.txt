speed up toggling info in level menu

after toggling info, go back to scroll position





speed up level menu

speed up winner menu

transforms for levels


easter egg: click on a grass, do something
something: cars are now intangible
in board description, a missing - or | means to allow the car off of the board...

grab red car as exiting, and drag to exit...

allow custom boards? does bigger than 6x6 work?



SOON:

fix dragging problem
episode 1, level 0
yellow truck collides, drag to right, but will move to left a little



jiggle car a little to indicate hitting other car, or currently locked because another car is still coasting

think about keeping track of user moves, when user goes back, like an undo, decrement counter, stack of user moves


only repaint dirty regions


world menu:
level info:
episode/pack/whatever, level index, #of cars, uuid(boards dims and placement of all cars), required moves, user moves, user time, user grade


little code in level menu:
# of loops, # of required moves, # cars



when dragging, if within 25% of stud, just go to it

no allocations when dragging
no allocations when coasting


menu
undo button
hint button

spiraling in GPPP.generalSearch?


density independent pixels
use graph paper and sketch out different screens and layouts first



DONE:

too easy to drag and overshoot on the grid, if within 15% just snap to it

too easy to get an F, scores are now more spread out


antialiasing?

render graph as separate image (make sure to cut off exit)

get rid of uithread and draw on demand
could draw from event thread from user actions (hilite menuitem, drag menu, drag car, winner menu appears)
or could draw from simulation thread, (shimmering menu items, shimmering car, coasting car, animated grass)

separate tutorial.zip, episode1.zip, episode2.zip
from main menu, have "tutorial", "episode1", ...

level menu,
"toggle information", display required moves and user moves

fix overflow on menu labels

Deadlock -> Capsloc
nothing "rush hour"

compress sprite sheet
compress car sheet


implement saving / restoring instances

small screens
big screens

auto-scroll level menu to first ungraded level

prevent panning when exiting board
keep board centered as car is leaving
make car go slow when exiting

problem with moving real truck on level 2 on AWT, when red car is in the way

slight fudge factor for menu scrolling



dynamic menu layout



menu
reset level button

in level menu screen, clear scores menu item




winner menu coming up is slow

SurfaceView stuff
screen size

winner menu:
try again




blocked car goes and hits the blocker and coasts back



scoring
time taken
moves made
saving scores, 


clip painting to screen

beat a level, do next, start second level, hit back, see empty board


no allocations in menus
no allocations in world idle

profile android


get BypassAWT build working

get BypassAndroid working (don't see MainActivity crap on startup)

switch over to using bypass everywhere
update artwork

icons for everything


save metadata in levels.zip
number of levels, etc.

zooming
as car is leaving grid, zoom


little shining animation for red car to start, and level buttons on level menu

scrolling for menus

start zooming as car leaves grid

max vel for flinging

dragging car to edge of grid takes it 


generalize menu painting

put up WinningMenu


figure out best way for zoom to follow car
so that dragging is not interrupted (kind of)

just paint all background on repaint

add perimeters around joint studs

when goign from stud to stud, always coast to the next stud, not to the previous one

make sure dragging doesn't get snagged

add long road from exit

coast from winning position off screen

test boards with exits on left and right, make sure exiting works

catch cars that are coasting

flicking

fix releasing on a vertex, snapping and blocking road

do coasting within the board, from stud to stud
 
when dragging, determine whether to coast forward or backward

save first vertex visited when dragging.

when released on a road, try to go to the other vertex (if space is available)



stop coasting after reentering board
