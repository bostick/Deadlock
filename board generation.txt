write down whole process for level generation and selection
level file format, no adjacent roads, only to adjacent sides, not on exit side, future work: cloverleafs





empty boards are enumerated in Deadlock/src/tools/java/solver/Boards.java
boards may never be removed or changed, only added to


the generate batch file is run with an argument, the board number
several transcript files are generated, with names like transcript-2-5-3.txt

this is a transcript for all boards with 2 2cars, 5 3cars, and empty board #3

inside each transcript file, the hardest board for each partition is recorded
needed a heuristic for only keeping a few boards out of the ton that are generated, and keeping the hardest seems ok
