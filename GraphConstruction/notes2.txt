filter out middle of colinear triples

filter out overlapping with existing edges and previous points in stroke


for each pair of points:
	figure out all events, in correct order (from oldest point to newest point)


possibilities for starting (can only be one):
	from empty
	from 1-vertex
	from 1+-vertex
	
possibilities for segment (can be multiple):
	through a middle point
	through between points
	through a 1-vertex
	through a 1+-vertex

possibilities for ending (can only be one):
	to empty
	to middle point
	to between points
	to 1-vertex
	to 1+-vertex



case between points:
	add point
case middle point:
	create vertex on point
case 1+-vertex
	add
	break
case 1-vertex:
	merge
	break
