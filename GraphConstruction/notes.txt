notes on graph construction:


immediately:
1 starting from middle point of existing segment - split existing
2 starting between existing segment - split existing
3 starting from start of existing segment - merge
4 starting from end of existing segment - merge
17 starting from empty

5 ending in middle point of existing segment - split existing
6 ending between existing segment - split existing
7 ending in start of existing segment - merge
8 ending in end of existing segment - merge
18 ending in empty

9 middle point shares middle point of existing segment - split both
10 middle point goes between existing segment - split both
11 middle point shares start of existing segment - split new
12 middle point shares end of existing segment - split new
19 middle point in empty

13 go through middle point of existing segment - split both
14 go through existing segment - split both
15 go through start of existing segment - split new
16 go through end of existing segment - split new
20 go through empty


TODO next:

vertex-oriented

handle automatic splitting of segments when an intersection is added
handle merging of segments when end points meet



display trace of currently drawing segment
when up, calculate everything


handle being attracted to start/end/intersection points

handle disallowing of drawing roads on top of other roads

handle disallowing of drawing roads too close to other roads





TODO later:

zooming in and out

deleting segments
