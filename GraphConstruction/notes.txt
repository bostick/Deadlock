notes on graph construction:


immediately:
1 starting from middle point of existing segment
2 starting between existing segment
3 starting from start of existing segment
4 starting from end of existing segment

5 ending in middle point of existing segment
6 ending between existing segment
7 ending in start of existing segment
8 ending in end of existing segment




TODO next:

handle automatic splitting of segments when an intersection is added
handle merging of segments when end points meet



display trace of currently drawing segment
when up, calculate everything

handle disallowing of drawing roads on top of other roads
handle disallowing of drawing roads too close to other roads





TODO later:

zooming in and out

deleting segments
