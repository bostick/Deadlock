IMMEDIATELY:

work on .graph package
move classes
make Graph a pure graph class
move Road, Merger, Sink, Source, etc. to .model


add SAT code
find uses of halfPlane
reexamine all bestHitTest implementations
WorldSource.active()
Car.computeDynamicProperties()



test if Merger is hitting anything else before adding



crashes
find a fire gif and start animating sprites

status of cursor
how many vertices, capsules, etc. currently hitting?

ideal physics
option to remove braking, friction, skidding, etc.


IN THE NEXT WEEK:

add countdowns

LONGTERM:

drive straight from one border to another without going through vertex center

add Tile
add Level
world serialization


quad tree implementation


switch to using floats


switch to opengl

start work on popup menu

DONE:

skids
line segments of when a car goes off-road
work on getting a separate layer to draw skids on, don't want individual line segment accumulating forever

remove sweepCircleCap

fix car goal point
overallPos is correct, but goalPoint is not correct inside of mergers

fix vertex distance problem
wiring up a merger backwards doesn't work

fix automatic merging of merger vertices
add 2 roads to a merger vertex

outline for regular cursor

skeleton for roads and mergers

add arrow images for sources and sinks

ON HOLD FOR NOW:

road shape desription
lines and circular arcs
adding capsules
stop using area, areax
constructive area geometry for edges

lower precision on stroke world points
