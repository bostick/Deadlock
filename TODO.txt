IMMEDIATELY:

insert stand-alone intersections

insert world sources/sinks
cursor with outline connecting source and sink along edge of quadrant

snap to grid

remember user actions, useful for undo, redo



add Quadrant
just 2x2 to start


enforce prohibition of roads on mergers

enforce prohibition of roads and mergers beyond the world sides

enforce prohibition of cars beyonds world sides

resizing window

SOON:

draw a loop
stand-alone loop

self-intersecting stroke


add countdowns/monitors:
which car will be coming next from which source?
what is the capacity of the entire world?
what is the flow of each source/sink?


debugging:
reversing from a crash
slowing down / speeding up simulation


add Level
scripting, saving, editing, etc.

start work on popup menu

LONGTERM:

quad tree implementation

switch to using floats

switch to opengl
or at least add it

cleanup user input
lines and curves for roads

DONE:

1-way directional arrows for roads
hit key to change direction of arrows

hover over where signs and arrows would be, hit key to add them

fix being too close to stop signs (think I've done this)

handle 2 events:
accelerating through intersection, and close to another car

radius for cars to see car in front on same road and brake

funky behavior with goalPoints and car proximity

car ids

skeleton in vertices

with ideal physics, need to update goalPoint intelligently
when at stopsign, gaolPoint is not being updated and it ending up directly under center of car, which leads to crazy behavior

ideal physics

crashes
find a fire gif and start animating sprites

fix adding 2 roads to a vertex and making it extend past world aabb
does not refresh world aabb

fix all seen problems with local input!

animated grass

test if Merger is hitting anything else before adding


skidding if completely off road

intersecting methods
containment methods

add shapes to capsules, vertices, cars, mergers, signs

add SAT code
find uses of halfPlane
reexamine all bestHitTest implementations
WorldSource.active()
Car.computeDynamicProperties()


add Circle and Quad classes

skids
line segments of when a car goes off-road
work on getting a separate layer to draw skids on, don't want individual line segment accumulating forever

remove sweepCircleCap

fix car goal point
overallPos is correct, but goalPoint is not correct inside of mergers

fix vertex distance problem
wiring up a merger backwards doesn't work

fix automatic merging of merger vertices
add 2 roads to a merger vertex

outline for regular cursor

skeleton for roads and mergers

add arrow images for sources and sinks

ON HOLD FOR NOW:

option to switch between real and ideal physics


radius for cars to see a crash and reroute

drive straight from one border to another without going through vertex center

status of cursor
how many vertices, capsules, etc. currently hitting?
diagnostics


work on .graph package
move classes
make Graph a pure graph class
move Road, Merger, Sink, Source, etc. to .model


road shape desription
lines and circular arcs
adding capsules
stop using area, areax
constructive area geometry for edges

lower precision on stroke world points
