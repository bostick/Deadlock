IMMEDIATELY:

enforce prohibition of roads on mergers

enforce prohibition of roads and mergers beyond the world sides

crashes
find a fire gif and start animating sprites

ideal physics
option to remove braking, friction, skidding, etc.


IN THE NEXT WEEK:

draw a loop
stand-alone loop


add countdowns

LONGTERM:

drive straight from one border to another without going through vertex center

add Tile
add Level
world serialization


quad tree implementation


switch to using floats


switch to opengl

start work on popup menu

DONE:

fix all seen problems with local input!

animated grass

test if Merger is hitting anything else before adding


skidding if completely off road

intersecting methods
containment methods

add shapes to capsules, vertices, cars, mergers, signs

add SAT code
find uses of halfPlane
reexamine all bestHitTest implementations
WorldSource.active()
Car.computeDynamicProperties()


add Circle and Quad classes

skids
line segments of when a car goes off-road
work on getting a separate layer to draw skids on, don't want individual line segment accumulating forever

remove sweepCircleCap

fix car goal point
overallPos is correct, but goalPoint is not correct inside of mergers

fix vertex distance problem
wiring up a merger backwards doesn't work

fix automatic merging of merger vertices
add 2 roads to a merger vertex

outline for regular cursor

skeleton for roads and mergers

add arrow images for sources and sinks

ON HOLD FOR NOW:


status of cursor
how many vertices, capsules, etc. currently hitting?
diagnostics


work on .graph package
move classes
make Graph a pure graph class
move Road, Merger, Sink, Source, etc. to .model


road shape desription
lines and circular arcs
adding capsules
stop using area, areax
constructive area geometry for edges

lower precision on stroke world points
