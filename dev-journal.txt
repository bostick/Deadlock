Looking at working with Java AST again, just wanting to get line counts of code, comments, blank lines.

Realized there is an analogy with reducing an AST to line counts, and projecting a shape onto an axis (from SAT)

There is a single "axis" that an AST gets "projected onto" to get simple info about line counts
Would "projecting onto" some other "axis" mean anything?
