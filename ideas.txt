cars are always spawning
editing and running are the same, must add roads as cars are going around


control queue of cars for each source
specify finite number of cars
specify infinite number of cars



delorean
88 mph
time travel
fire road marks



mowing down grass, mowing down buildings


on menu screen:
have car drive into menu item when hilited (to show how game works)

have simple world going in background, with crashes (to show how game works)


shutter mode:
require a button press to advance next timestep

debug shutter mode:
somehow display all entities, points, etc. that were queried that time step
help with tracking down unecessary work being done




capture the flag:
2 players, 4 players
auto-generated map:
big center area, randomly generated branches, all 4 branches symmetrical
fog of war
can lay down roads, but only a car driving by will illuminate surroudning area
get points for having cars get sinked

cannot delete roads

crashing





unlockers
vertices a and b are linked.
leaving b unlocks a and lets cars enter a
for one-way roads
normally an intersection is it's own unlocker

vertex can also be unlocked by a timer

a sink can be a source's unlocker






code organization:
find common interface for World and Menu, "thing that has focus"
inside World, different cursors can have focus

try to remove as many switch statements as possible

going from special cursor back to normal: like returning

CircleCursor should not know anything about World

try to remove as many references to APP.world and APP.menu as possible


focus hierarchy for keyboard and mouse:
APP -> world -> circlecursor -> knob
APP -> menu -> menuitem

returning:
from special cursor to RegularCursor
how best to transfer that?
manage other things like hilited
